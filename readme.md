## Larify

Larify is currently a small project using the Laravel Framework and Spotify API. It will allow a specified playlist to be managed by various
users with a certain amount of tracks per user.

The need for this app comes from a small office in East London who'd like to allow staff to compile a playlist between them fairly for office music.
